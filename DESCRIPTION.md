# Project description

Prime Modular Dynamics Theory (PMDT) is a theoretical and computational framework for studying
the modular dynamics of prime numbers via the SG(k) families. The project combines:

- rigorous modular definitions (SG(k), transition matrices, entropy, detailed balance),
- a complete numerical pipeline implemented in Python,
- systematic exploration of SG(k) for \(2 \le k \le 60\),
- visualization of transition structures (heatmaps, scatter plots),
- detection of hidden periodicities (6, 9, 18) in prime gap dynamics.

The goal of this repository is to provide a fully reproducible environment for:

- regenerating all numerical results and figures,
- compiling the LaTeX article,
- extending PMDT to larger ranges of \(k\) or other modular bases.
