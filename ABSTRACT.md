# Abstract

We study the modular dynamics of prime numbers through the families



\[
SG(k) = \{ p \in \mathbb{P} : kp + 1 \in \mathbb{P} \}.
\]



When projected onto the 8 admissible residues modulo 30, these families reveal a rich dynamical
structure underlying the global distribution of primes. We show that SG(k) organizes itself into
three distinct dynamical phases, repeating with a strict periodicity of 6 in the parameter \(k\).
These phases correspond to a rigid phase, an intermediate phase, and a resonant phase reproducing
the full global prime dynamics.

We further show that the gap-6 transitions (sexy primes) contain a hidden period-9 resonance, and
that the interaction between the SG(k) periodicity (6) and the sexy-prime resonance (9) produces
a combined periodicity of 18. This repository contains the full theoretical article, numerical
pipeline, data, and figures that support what we call **Prime Modular Dynamics Theory (PMDT)**.
